# Todo

## Appflow redesign
- No more generated phrase list that can be navigated ✅
- User will now generate spacephrase with spacebar (?)
- Binding to append passphrases user likes to file (?)
- New passphrase on option change (phrase-len, seperator (-), Titlecase checkbox, optional ending number) ✅


## Permutation count
Docked label (static?) that calculates permutation/combintation count, fun tidbit.

The css would look like
`offset: 0 -1;` iirc

## Security Disclaimer Screen
- Define what a passphrase is, the benefits of them
- Attach link to xkcb comic strip (paying homage 🙏)
- textual-passphrase is theoretically a security risk. It is a novelty app that deals with plain text files. A compromised .phrases file *could* be devistating

## Custom widget to handle numbers
- Incrementer/decrementer (?)
- Focusable static, that increments with up & down arrows
